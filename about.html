              <p>
                This is my website that I programmed to serve as a study tool for my personal study of the New Testament. The site helps me in my New Testament study as it is a dashboard to access many different online study resources. The resources include digital bible texts, bible videos, bible translations, new testament art, come follow me articles, and scholarly articles. 
                <br><br>
                I incorporated the New Testament into my project through building my website around the question of what resources would best enhance my study of the New Testament. It took me about two hours over the last six weeks to both learn how to program ( HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and create the website. I used free video tutorials on YouTube to learn the necessary skills.

                Spiritually Strengthening
              </p>
              <p>
                This project was spiritually strengthening as I used the site for my personal study of the New Testament. I dove deep into prayerfully considering which resources would bring me closer to Heavenly Father. I found that the bible translation comparison sites helped me to better understand the language of the New Testament and therefore better connect with the stories and teachings. I also found that the church’s bible videos strengthened my testimony of the Savior and greatly enhanced my study. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Intellectually Enlarging
              </p>
              <p>
                My New Testament project was very challenging and enlarging intellectually. I never built a website before this project, so I was starting from square one. I ran into many obstacles and error messages throughout the process, but with persistence and research I was able to overcome them. This project helped boost my confidence in my ability to learn more technology skills that I aim at in the future. This experience also solidified my belief that the best way to learn something is through experience using the skill or knowledge that you are seeking.

                Character Building
              </p>
              <p>
                My project built my character as I gained more humility through turning to others for help with the difficulties that I came across in the process of building the website. I have a friend who has more experience with programming, so I went to him with some questions throughout the process. I also built persistence and resilience as I continued to return to work on the project through all of the obstacles that I faced. Patience was another attribute that was refined through this project. For example, I faced one bug in my programming that I worked on for 45 minutes until I finally found a solution.

                Lifelong Learning and Service
              </p>
              <p>
                This project helped me develop my skills and attitudes relating to lifelong learning and service. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of spending time learning and building something that I wanted to do. I felt that because it was my own project, it was easier to stay motivated during the whole process. Now I feel more empowered to continue learning about topics that interest me in the future and building out academic projects for fun. I also saw how now with the skills that I developed with programming my website, I can turn around and help others learn the same skills.

              <h2 class="mb-4 display-4">Time and Process</h2>

              <p>
                I spent about 12 hours on my project over the course of the last six weeks. I started by planning out what I wanted my website to do and what I wanted it to look like. 
                <br><br>
                Then, I started watching YouTube video tutorials to learn how to write HTML code. I started programming the HTML pages, then I started watching videos on programming with CSS, and I started incorporating CSS into my website. Finally, I learned about how to use JavaScript with web development, and then I implemented JavaScript to give the website more functionality.
                </p>

          </div>

          <div class="d-md-flex post-entry-2 half mt-5">

              <img src="assets/img/post-landscape-1.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </a>
            <div class="pe-md-5 mt-4 mt-md-0">
              <div class="post-meta mt-4">4. Overall, how pleased are you with your final product and how well do you feel like you did on this assignment overall?

              </div>
              <h2 class="mb-4 display-4">Self Evaluation</h2>
              <p>
              I am very pleased with my final product and I feel like I did my best work on the assignment.
              </p>
              <p>
              I could have done a better job with being more efficient at the beginning of the process. I spent a lot of time watching tutorials without following along and I thought that I was learning the concepts, but I realized that I really wasn’t learning until I was actually writing my own programs.              </p>
